Hello! :)

It's incredible how much time an idea takes to get to real world, if you just keep thinking about it. I had planned to start blogging for a long time now, and here I am, almost 3 years after, doing it for the first time!

At first, I was wondering what tools/technologies should I use? build my own blog? use a platform like wordpress, medium, etc. There are so many choices out there and now it is easier than never to do it. No one is expecting you make the right decision, more important than tools is you desire to share what you have in mind so don't spend too much time on this first phase, just find something that fits your needs try it and if it doesn't work as you expected, you're free to move to the brand new platform/tool. Fail quickly. Adapt. Try again. BTW, I'm using Jekyll and I'm hosting my blog in GitHub.
