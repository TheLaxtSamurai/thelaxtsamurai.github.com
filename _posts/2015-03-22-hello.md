Hello! :)

It's incredible how much time an idea takes to get to the real world, if you just keep thinking about it. I had planned to start blogging for a long time now, and here I am, almost 3 years after, doing it for the first time!

At first, I was wondering what tools/technologies should I use? Should I build my own blog? SHould I use a platform like wordpress, medium, etc? There are so many choices out there, and now, it is easier than ever to do it. No one is expecting you make the right decision, more important than tools is your desire to share what you have in mind so don't spend too much time on this first phase, just find the platform/tools that fits your needs, try them, and if it doesn't work as you expected, you're free to move to the brand new platform/tool, it's not a waste of time, it's just another learning experience. Fail quickly. Adapt. Repeat. BTW, This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).
