I'm a software engineer from

and currently a senior software architect at

When not working, I like reading about IT, biographies and personal finances. I'm in a long journey of becoming better everyday (personally and professionally), commited to my craft and eagerly to help other people along the way. Family-centered guy, my beautiful wife and my little buddy are my ever-lasting motivation.

Wanna talk about something? Send me an [email](mailto:federico.v.garcia@gmail.com).
